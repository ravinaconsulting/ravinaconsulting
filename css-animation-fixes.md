## CSS and Animation Issues Found

1. Background Image Path Issue:
   - In styles.css, the hero background image uses "bg_blue.jpg" but the file isn't in the root directory
   - Path should likely be "images/bg_blue.jpg"

2. Potential AOS Issues:
   - AOS CSS is loaded correctly (via CDN)
   - AOS JS is loaded correctly (via CDN)
   - Initialization looks correct in script.js

3. CSS Loading Order:
   - Base styles.css is loaded first (correct)
   - All component CSS files are loaded in proper order
   - AOS CSS is loaded last (correct)

Recommended Fixes:
1. Update background image path in styles.css
2. Verify all other image paths
3. Check browser console for any JS errors that might prevent AOS from initializing
4. Consider adding fallback fonts to font-family declarations
5. Add error handling around AOS initialization

These issues will be fixed in subsequent steps.
